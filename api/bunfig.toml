# Bun configuration file
# This file configures Bun's runtime behavior

# Note: Bun's test runner automatically looks for test files matching:
# **/*.{test,spec}.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}
#
# To run tests: bun test
# To run with coverage: bun test --coverage
# To run in watch mode: bun test --watch
#
# Test setup is handled in tests/setup.ts which should be imported
# at the beginning of test files or configured via test preload
